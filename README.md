# network-router-project
This is the code for an implementation of RIPv2 with Javascript and Node.js for GSU's Computer Networks course.


Node is required to run these files. Node can be downloaded and installed with directions from https://nodejs.org/en/download/


To run these files do the following:
1. Run ```$ npm install``` within the root directory of the project.
2. Run ```$ node router.js``` within the directory to start a router.
3. Run ```$ node client.js``` within the directory to start a client.
4. Run ```$ node server.js``` to start a server.


Note that each file should be run on a seperate computer. Once several routers are running on the same network their routing tables should begin to converge, which can be seen in the console output.
